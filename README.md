#Assessment Test#

This repository contains JavaScript functions designed to solve various coding challenges without using built-in functions like sort, reverse, etc. Each challenge has its own file named questionX.js (where X is the question number). You can run each test individually using Node.js by navigating to the folder and running the following command:

#Bash#

node questionX.js
Use code with caution.

List of Questions:

question1.js: Sorts an array in descending order.
question2.js: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
question3.js: Finds the sum of the two largest numbers in an array.
question4.js: Finds missing elements from 0 to the highest entry in an array.
question5.js: Finds the most frequent number and its count in an array.
question6.js: Rotates an array to the right by one position.

Running the Tests:

To run all tests, you can use a script like run_all_tests.sh (assuming a bash environment). This script would iterate through each questionX.js file and execute them sequentially.

Note: This script is not provided but can be easily created for convenience.
